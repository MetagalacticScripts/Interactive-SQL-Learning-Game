## Features

- **Fully Dynamic & Responsive:**  
  The game adapts its layout for both desktop and mobile devices so you can learn SQL anywhere.

- **Interactive SQL Challenges:**  
  Choose from three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Advanced) and answer real SQL query challenges. The game checks your query result instead of the exact query text, so you can focus on getting the correct answer.

- **New Board Each Game:**  
  Every time you start or progress through the game, a brand-new board is generated, ensuring endless replayability.

- **Real-Time Scoring:**  
  Your moves and the time taken are tracked. When you reach the Candy Castle, your final score (including move count and elapsed time) is recorded on the public scoreboard.

- **Open Source:**  
  The complete source code is available. Feel free to inspect, modify, or contribute improvements. See what others can do with it!

## How to Play

1. **Select Your Character:**  
   Choose from fun icons like üç≠, üç¨, or üç´ to represent you on your journey.

2. **Receive a Challenge:**  
   Click on a path (Easy, Medium, or Advanced) to receive an SQL challenge. The challenge appears as an incomplete or intended query that you must correct or produce a result for.

3. **Submit Your Query:**  
   Type your SQL query into the input area. The game checks the result of your query (rather than the literal query text) against the expected output.

4. **Advance Your Character:**  
   If your query returns the correct result, your character moves forward on the board. If your answer is wrong, you‚Äôll receive a prompt to try again (or use a hint). Special tiles may require additional correct answers to clear.

5. **Reach the Candy Castle:**  
   Successfully answer challenges and navigate the board to reach the Candy Castle. Your final score is then recorded on the scoreboard.
